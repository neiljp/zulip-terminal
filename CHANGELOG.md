# Zulip-terminal Changelog

## 0.6.0 - 28 January 2021 [PROVISIONAL]

This release contains the second set of contributions from our two 2019
[GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) students, as well as
[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) participants and a
range of various other contributors - thanks to them
[all](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-terminal/graphs/contributors?from=2020-07-30&to=2021-01-28&type=c)
for raising the standard of the project once again!

Now is a great time to give the project a try, with more features than ever and
the newly-added 'explore mode' (`--explore` on the command-line) ensuring that
no messages get marked as read in your client while you're just giving it a
try!

### IMPORTANT NOTES

Other than a range of great new features, ... **TODO**

#### Python 3.5
This will be the last release with support for python 3.5, for which
support has now ended upstream (see #838).

#### Customized installs
If you've customized your install by editing themes or keys, be sure
to back these up before upgrading and then carefully integrate them.

### HIGHLIGHTS
- Message composition feels a lot cleaner!
  - new design for entering message recipients, with stream & topic autocomplete available
  - interactive feedback shows whether recipients are valid on edit/autocomplete (<kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>f</kbd>/<kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>r</kbd>) and/or <kbd>tab</kbd>
- Editing of sent messages is much more feature-complete!
  - most editing modes are supported - rename partial or full topics
  - message edit history is accessible via Message information popup
- Jump (narrow) to linked streams or topics in messages via the Message information popup!
  - new quoted messages include the original author and contextual links
- Session-only draft feature supports pausing composition to review other messages (<kbd>meta</kbd>-<kbd>s</kbd> / <kbd>d</kbd>)
- Improved popup design including theming by popup category, with more information accessible in popups
- Various smaller updates to match existing and new features from Zulip 3.x
  - time mentions and organization emoji in messages, re-styled user list, 'no topic' messages, ...

## 0.5.2 - 30 July 2020

This release contains the first batch of changes from this year's GSoC students, among other contributors - we're keen to get this out and let you have the improvements available!

### SECURITY NOTICE
This release fixes two security issues, so we strongly recommend upgrading immediately.

Note that notifications while running in WSL are temporarily removed in this release due to this.

### HIGHLIGHTS
- Links in messages are now shown more clearly with numeric references, with URLs as optional footnotes ('footlinks') and in the message information popup (#703/#618/#735)
- Typeahead/autocomplete suggestions are now shown dynamically in the footer (#540)
- The previous stream description popup can now be used to adjust stream properties (muting, pinning) (#695)
- An About popup was added to check application and server versions while running (#653/#616)
- Stream search and typeahead suggestions are ordered consistently, based on pinning and word sorting (#530)
- Messages from the server due to user-triggered interactions that fail are reported in the footer (#714/#427)
- Popup notifications for streams respect the desktop-notifications setting (#669)

### Interactivity improvements
- Messages are not marked as read while browsing through messages resulting from a search (#624/#723)
- On searching with no search text, exit search and focus on the list below (don't perform an empty search) (#551)
- Require <kbd>esc</kbd> to exit message compose box - avoiding loss of draft upon clicking elsewhere (#720/#652)
- Autocomplete now triggers correctly with leading text (including parentheses), eg `(#str` (#542)

### Visual improvements
- Pinned and unpinned streams are shown with a separator while searching (#577)
- Message reactions are shown clearer in the message information popup (#659)
- Links within messages are listed in the message information popup, above reactions (#708)

### Important bugfixes
- Fixed crash on startup, related to looking up unsubscribed streams with unread counts (#694/#706)
- Fixed crash when trying to send private message from user list (#677)
- Fix security issue due to limited quote escaping in notifications
- Fix security issue when running in profiling mode (fixed filename in /tmp)
- Upgraded dependencies, leading to fix for color support in mosh & urxvt (via urwid 2.1.1)
- Ensure recipient headers are shown in narrow message view (#671/#672)
- Unread counts and message updating continue to be improved (#711/#697/#696)

### Infrastructure improvements
- Known working terminal emulators added to `FAQ.md` - moved from `README` into `docs/` (#689)

## 0.5.1 - 13 May 2020

While not composed of as many significant changes as 0.5.0, this is a meaningful release focusing on message and UI improvements - enjoy!

### HIGHLIGHTS
- Lists in messages are displayed much more compactly, represent bulleted and numbered styles accurately, and indent appropriately for nested lists!
- Reactions are rendered more accurately and consistently, and are styled differently if you've reacted
- Bars adjacent to topic names and private message recipients are colored appropriately and thinner
- Theme names have changed to *zt_dark*, *zt_light*, *zt_blue* and *gruvbox_dark* (**NOTE** old names will continue working for now)
- Default (now *zt_dark*) theme colors should work more reliably across terminals
- Support for color depths other than the previous 256-color mode, including a polished monochrome mode, with new '--color-depth' option
- Stream/topic/user searches are clearly marked when they are in effect, in line with message search

### Interactivity improvements
- Move focus fully into topic search box before entering text (don't leave topic selected)
- After topic search, return to previously selected topic
- Clearly indicate when a stream/topic/user search is in effect, in line with message search

### Visual improvements
- Use bullet characters for unordered lists, in place of stars
- Render numbered lists fully and according to Zulip style (previously rendered as bulleted lists)
- Support nested lists (bulleted and numbered)
- Style reaction counts which include yourself differently (inverted colors, typically)
- Sort reactions alphabetically for consistency
- Support color depths other than 256-colors; try --color-depth=1 for a retro, high-constrast experience!
- Improve specificity of colors in default theme, enhancing rendering and consistency in 256 color mode
- Use triangle symbol (â–¶) to separate streams and topics, instead of simply '>'
- The 'bar' extending from topics or private message recipients is now thinner and colored if a stream

### Important bugfixes
- If notifications are enabled but the external script was not found, cleanly warn the user just once per session and avoid showing a traceback over the screen
- Names of reactions and inline emoji for the same icon could be different - use emoji list from Zulip server to unify them and remove dependency on emoji package
- Remove extra newlines present in lists, improving rendering and leading to better use of screen space

### Infrastructure improvements
- Improve Installation/Running/Configuration in README, including noting how to run a snapshot of the current development version, and that we have Dockerfiles
- Lint locally and in CI using flake8 (instead of pycodestyle), with continuation & quotes plugins, enforcing stricter, clearer rules on code style
- Tidy code using pyupgrade
